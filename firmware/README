How to compile the Trackuino firmware:
--------------------------------------

1. Copy the "trackuino" folder into your Arduino sketches folder.

2. Launch the Arduino IDE and open up the sketch. You need version 23 of the
Arduino IDE.

3. Locate the "config.h" tab and replace settings with your own (YOUR CALLSIGN
   GOES THERE).

4. When uploading the firmware, unplug the GPS or flashing will fail with an
error.
